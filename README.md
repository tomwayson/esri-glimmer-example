# esri-glimmer-example

An example of how to use the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript] in a [glimmerjs] application.

![Screenshot](esri-glimmer-example-screenshot.jpg)

This uses the pattern (and a copy of the code) from [esri-loader](https://github.com/tomwayson/esri-loader) to lazy-load the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in a glimmer app. 

This is a work in progress hacked up w/ [@odoe](https://github.com/odoe/) at EmberConf 2017.
